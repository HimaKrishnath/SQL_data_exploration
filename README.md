•	Retrieving data from the coviddeaths and covidvaccination tables.
•	Sorting data by date and continent.
•	Analyzing total cases, total deaths, and death percentages.
•	Examining infection rates and population percentages.
•	Identifying countries with the highest infection rates and death counts per population.
•	Summarizing global numbers of new cases, new deaths, and death percentages.
•	Joining the coviddeaths and covidvaccination tables to combine data.
•	Calculating rolling sums of new vaccinations using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and by creating temporary tables.

Usage:
To use these queries, connect to your MySQL database and execute the desired query using a MySQL client or interface. You can copy the specific query you are interested in and run it against your database to retrieve the corresponding results.
Make sure to adjust the table names (coviddeaths and covidvaccination) if they differ in your database.
