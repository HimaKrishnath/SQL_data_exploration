COVID Data Analysis:

This repository contains SQL queries for analyzing COVID-19 data related to deaths, vaccinations, and population. The queries retrieve information from the coviddeaths and covidvaccination tables.
Overview:

The provided SQL queries perform various analyses on COVID-19 data. They cover the following aspects:
•	Retrieving data from the coviddeaths and covidvaccination tables.
•	Sorting data by date and continent.
•	Analyzing total cases, total deaths, and death percentages.
•	Examining infection rates and population percentages.
•	Identifying countries with the highest infection rates and death counts per population.
•	Summarizing global numbers of new cases, new deaths, and death percentages.
•	Joining the coviddeaths and covidvaccination tables to combine data.
•	Calculating rolling sums of new vaccinations using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and by creating temporary tables.

Usage:
To use these queries, connect to your MySQL database and execute the desired query using a MySQL client or interface. You can copy the specific query you are interested in and run it against your database to retrieve the corresponding results.
Make sure to adjust the table names (coviddeaths and covidvaccination) if they differ in your database.
Feel free to modify and customize the queries as needed to suit your specific analysis requirements.
